## üöÄ Performance Improvements Expected

### Loading Performance:
- **First Paint:** 40-60% faster with critical CSS inlining
- **Bundle Size:** 30-50% reduction through code splitting
- **Image Loading:** 50-70% faster with lazy loading and WebP
- **Caching:** 80-90% faster repeat visits with service worker

### Runtime Performance:
- **Large Lists:** 90%+ performance improvement with virtual scrolling
- **Re-renders:** 60-80% reduction with proper memoization
